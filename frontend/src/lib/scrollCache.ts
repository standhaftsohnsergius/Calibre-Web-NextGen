/* In-memory catalog scroll/state cache.
 *
 * The library/browse grid is an accumulating "Load more" list scrolled on the
 * window. When you open a book and press Back, wouter remounts the catalog fresh
 * — losing the loaded pages and the scroll position (#578). Browsers can't
 * restore scroll here because the content is fetched client-side and isn't in the
 * DOM at restore time.
 *
 * So we stash the catalog's render-relevant state (loaded pages + filters +
 * scrollY) in a module-level Map keyed by route, and rehydrate it on remount.
 * It's in-memory (not sessionStorage): it survives client-side back/forward
 * within the SPA session — the exact case that broke — without serialization
 * cost or storage limits, and is intentionally dropped on a full page reload
 * (where a top-of-page start is expected). Bounded so a long session can't grow
 * it without limit.
