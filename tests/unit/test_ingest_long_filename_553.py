"""Regression tests for issue #553 — uploading a file whose name is long
enough to push the staging path component past the filesystem NAME_MAX
(255 bytes) raised ``OSError [Errno 36] File name too long`` and the upload
failed with the opaque "Failed to queue for processing" message.

The ingest service renames imported books from their metadata, so the staging
name is throwaway — the fix truncates it to fit instead of erroring. These
tests pin that the constructed ingest path always fits NAME_MAX (accounting
for the ".uploading"/".cwa.json" suffixes the pipeline appends downstream),
keeps the file extension, and leaves normal-length uploads untouched.
